# Gearbox protocol

Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol. It has two sides to it: passive liquidity providers who earn low-risk APY by providing single-asset liquidity; and active farmers, firms, or even other protocols who borrow those assets to trade or farm with even x10 leverage.

Gearbox Protocol allows anyone to take DeFi-native leverage and then use it across various (DeFi & more) protocols in a composable way. You take leverage with Gearbox and then use it on other protocols you already love: Uniswap, Curve, Convex, Lido, etc. For example, you can leverage trade on Uniswap, leverage farm on Yearn, make delta-neutral strategies, get Leverage-as-a-Service for your structured product, and more... Thanks to the Credit Accounts primitive!

_Some compare composable leverage as a primitive to DeFi-native prime brokerage._
